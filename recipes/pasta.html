    <p> <h2> Quick, easy and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty</h2></p>
    <p> <h1> Ingredients</h1></p>

    <ul> <h3> 
        <li> 1 box of elbow macaroni;</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup of butter;</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour;</li>
        <li> 1/2 tablespoon salt;</li>
        <li> ground black pepper;</li>
        <li> 2 cups of milk;</li>
        <li> 2 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ul> </h3>

    <p> <h1> How to make pasta with cheese step-by step</h1></p>

    <ol> <h3> 
        <li> Boil macaroni: bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni untill al dente, about 8 minutes;</li>
        <li> Make a roux: a roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. Start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling;</li>
        <li> Add cheese and macaroni: Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</li>

    </ol> </h3>
